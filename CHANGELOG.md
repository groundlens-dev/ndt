# Changelog

All notable changes to the Neural Dimensionality Tracker will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## 2.0.0 -- The validity harness

### Changed
- **Toolchain unified to `ruff`** (formatting, linting and import sorting), replacing
  black + isort + flake8, and pinned to a single version. This ends the format-drift
  that came from three unpinned formatters on an EOL Python. CI runs `ruff check` and
  `ruff format --check`. Applied `raise ... from e` in the SVD error paths and cleaned
  unused loop variables surfaced by the linter.

### Added
- **`ndt.validity`**: a validity harness for transition detectors. Run any
  detector against ground-truth fixtures (`planted_transition`, `planted_multi`,
  `pure_noise`, `drift_no_jump`) and get a `ValidityReport` with recall on known
  transitions and false-positive rate on known nulls, plus a plain verdict.
  Synthetic fixtures cost nothing to generate; real-model fixtures (e.g. a
  grokking run) plug into the same `Fixture` interface. New public API:
  `validate_detector`, `jump_detector_as_callable`, `ValidityReport`,
  `standard_battery`.

### Changed
- **Positioning corrected.** The README no longer claims ndt reliably "detects
  discrete phase transitions." The companion study shows detectors built on
  these metrics disagree with each other (threshold vs PELT correlate at -0.029)
  and none is consistent across metrics. The included `JumpDetector` is now
  documented as one detector to be validated, not a truth oracle. ndt's
  distinctive value is the check, not the claim.
- License field in `pyproject.toml` set to Apache-2.0 to match the LICENSE file
  and the badge (was MIT).
- Repository moved from the groundlens-dev organization to the author's account
  (`Javihaus/ndt`); all URLs updated.

## [1.0.2] - 2025-11-13

### Changed
- Package name changed to `ndtracker` on PyPI (name `ndt` was already taken)
- Install command: `pip install ndtracker`
- Import remains: `import ndt`

### Fixed
- Fixed version synchronization between `pyproject.toml` and `__version__.py`
- Package now correctly reports version 1.0.2 when installed

## [1.0.1] - 2025-11-13

### Fixed
- Merge and synchronization updates for stability

## [1.0.0] - 2025-11-13

### Changed
- Package name changed to `ndtracker` on PyPI (name `ndt` was already taken)
  - Install with `pip install ndtracker`
  - Import as `import ndt` (module name unchanged)
  - Updated package name for PyPI compatibility

### Fixed
- PyPI packaging compatibility by constraining setuptools to <70.0
- Removed duplicate license classifier to avoid metadata conflicts
- Fixed GitHub Actions publish workflow for tag push events
- Package now passes twine validation checks
