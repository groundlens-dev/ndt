Neural Dimensionality Tracker tracks how a network's representational dimensionality evolves during training, across MLPs, CNNs, Transformers and Vision Transformers, and it does one thing no other tracker does: **it tells you whether a detected phase transition is real or an artifact of your detection method.**

In a companion study across 55 experiments and 30,147 measurement points, transition detectors built on these same metrics disagreed with each other almost completely (a threshold detector and the threshold-free PELT algorithm correlated at -0.029), and no transition appeared consistently across metrics. A detector can report a clean "phase transition" that is nothing but its own response to noise. So before you build a theory on a detected transition, run the validity harness on your detector and see what it does on ground truth you control.

## Features

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
|**Validity harness** | Test any transition detector against ground-truth fixtures (a known transition and a known null) and get a plain verdict on whether its detections can be trusted. Runs in milliseconds, no training required.|
|**Dimensionality tracking** | Add tracking to any PyTorch model in three lines, across MLPs, CNNs, Transformers and Vision Transformers.|
|**Four complementary metrics** | Participation ratio, stable rank, cumulative energy, nuclear-norm ratio.|
|**Transition detection, honestly framed** | A z-score jump detector is included as *one* detector to be validated, not a truth oracle. Check it before you trust it.|
|**Rich visualization** and **flexible export** | (CSV, JSON, HDF5).|


## Installation

```bash
pip install ndtracker
```

## Check your detector before you trust it

```python
from ndt import JumpDetector
from ndt.validity import validate_detector, jump_detector_as_callable

detector = jump_detector_as_callable(JumpDetector(z_threshold=3.0))
report = validate_detector(detector, name="JumpDetector(z=3.0)")
print(report.render())
```

```
Validity report for: JumpDetector(z=3.0)

  planted_transition   recall: 1.00   false positives:   5
  planted_multi        recall: 1.00   false positives:  14
  pure_noise           null control   false positives:   2 (5.0/1000 steps)
  drift_no_jump        null control   false positives:   4 (10.0/1000 steps)

  mean recall on planted transitions : 1.00
  false positives on null controls   : 6

  VERDICT: NOT VALID on these fixtures
  Fires on pure noise and continuous drift. It manufactures transitions where
  there are none, so a detection on real data cannot be trusted without this check.
```

The point is not that this detector is bad. It is that it recovers real transitions *and* fires on noise, so a bare detection count means little until you know its false-positive rate on a null. The harness gives you that number. Plug in your own detector (any callable from a value sequence to detected step indices), or your own fixtures, including a real grokking run where the transition is visible in test accuracy.

## Quick Start

```python
import torch.nn as nn
from ndt import HighFrequencyTracker

# Your model
model = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Linear(784, 512), nn.ReLU(),
    nn.Linear(512, 256), nn.ReLU(),
    nn.Linear(256, 10)
)

# Create tracker
tracker = HighFrequencyTracker(model, sampling_frequency=10)

# Training loop
for step, (x, y) in enumerate(dataloader):
    output = model(x)
    loss = criterion(output, y)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

    tracker.log(step, loss.item())  # One line!

# Analyze
results = tracker.get_results()
from ndt import plot_phases
plot_phases(results, metric="stable_rank")
```
